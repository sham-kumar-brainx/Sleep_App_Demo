## Features

1. **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase more modular and testable.

2. **UIKit Framework**: The PidebienDesignDemo App is built entirely using UIKit, Apple's framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. This project leverages several UIKit components and features, including:
- ***Collection View***: Used to efficiently display and manage a collection of items in various layouts.
- ***Table View***: Employed to present structured data in a tabular format with rows and sections.
- ***Scroll View***: Utilized to enable smooth scrolling through content that exceeds the screen size.
- ***Blur Effect***: Applied to enhance the visual aesthetics of certain UI elements using a blurred background.
- ***Side Menu***: Integrated into the navigation flow to offer users quick access to different app sections or functionalities.
- ***Sheets***: Employed to display temporary modal views that slide in from the bottom or top, presenting contextual information or actions.
- ***Storyboards***: Utilized for designing high-level app flow and navigation between different screens, offering a visual representation of the app's structure.
- ***XIBs***: Utilized for creating individual interface components or views, supporting a modular approach to UI design.
